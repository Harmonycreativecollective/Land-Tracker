## Android Install (PWA)
- Open the deployed KB Land site in Chrome on Android.
- In Chrome menu, tap **Install app** (or **Add to Home screen**, depending on version).
- Confirm install and launch from your home screen.

If the app name/icon does not update:
- Delete the existing home screen shortcut/app for the site.
- In Chrome, clear cached site data for that URL.
- Re-open the site and install again.

## Local Status Verification

Run one scrape, then verify a known listing status in Supabase:

```bash
python scraper.py
python - <<'PY'
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from supabase import create_client

load_dotenv()
supabase = create_client(os.environ["SUPABASE_URL"], os.environ["SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"])

url = "https://www.landsearch.com/properties/1-ridge-rd-colonial-beach-va-22443/5039580"
res = (
    supabase.table("listings")
    .select("url,status,last_seen_utc")
    .eq("url", url)
    .limit(1)
    .execute()
)
row = (res.data or [{}])[0]
print({"url": row.get("url"), "status": row.get("status"), "last_seen_utc": row.get("last_seen_utc")})
PY
```

Expected result after scrape: `status` should be `pending` (or `under_contract` if page status changed).
